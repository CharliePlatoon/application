# Challenge 1.3 (Easy #3)
Write a method/function that takes a string and counts how many colors are used in that string. For the purposes of our challenge, let's say all the available colors are: blue, green, brown, gray, red, black, and purple.

Example: 
```python
color_counter('the quick brown fox jumped over the purple dog') 
# returns 2 because the string has two of the colors in it
```
