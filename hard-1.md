## Pig Latin
If you are unfamiliar with Pig Latin check out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin.

For this problem we want to convert all the words in a sentence into our own, simplified version of pig latin:

If a word starts with a consonant move all the letters before the first vowel to the end and add 'ay'. If a word starts with a vowel (count 'y' as a vowel) just add 'way'.

Example: "bob" would be changed to "obbay"
Example: "pig" would be changed to "igpay"
Example: "latin" would be changed to "atinlay"
Example: "banana" would be changed to "ananabay"
Example: "school" would be changed to "oolschay"
Example: "one" would be changed to "oneway"
Example: "or" would be changed to "orway"
Example: "This is a test" would be changed to "isThay isway away esttay"
