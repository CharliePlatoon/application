# Challenge 2.2 (Medium #2)

Write a function/method that takes a number to insert and an array of integers, return the lowest index at which the number to insert can be put into the array of numbers. Assume that the array of numbers is always sorted.

Example: 

```ruby
lowest_index_insert(3, [1,2,5])
# returns 2 because index 2 of the array is the where the number to insert (3) would be inserted
```
