# Challenge 2.1 (Medium #1)

Write a method that takes an integer array and a desired sum. The output will be pairs of numbers from the inputed integer array that equal that desired sum. If there are no pairs that work, return 'unable to find pairs'

Example: `sumPairs([1,2,3,4,5], 9)` would return `[4,5]` because only the numbers 4 and 5 when added together equal the target number of 9
Example: `sumPairs([3,1,5,8,2], 27)` would return `unable to find pairs` because there are no two numbers in the array that can be added together to equal the target number of 27
