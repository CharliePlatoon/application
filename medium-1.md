# Challenge 2.1 (Medium #1)

Given a target number and a sorted list of numbers, return the index of the target number. If the index does not exist, return -1.

Example: 5 and [1,2,3,4,5] would return 4 because the target number 5 is at index 4
Example: 5 and [1,2,3,4] would return -1 because the target number 5 is not in the array
