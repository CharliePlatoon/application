# Challenge 1.1 (Easy #1)

Write a method/function that takes a string and counts the number of words that begin and end with the same letter.

Example: 
```ruby
same_first_and_last('Trout like to eat toast when they see a kayak') # Returns number 4 because trout, toast, a, and kayak start and end with the same letter.
```
