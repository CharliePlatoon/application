# Challenge 1.1 (Easy #1)

Write a method that takes a string and counts the number of words that begin and end with the same letter.

Example: `same_first_and_last('Trout like to eat toast when they see a kayak')` would return the number `4` because trout, toast, a, and kayak start and end with the same letter.
