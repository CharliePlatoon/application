# Application for Code Platoon

This portion of the application will help us determine and measure your programming ability. You may find some of these challenges to be more difficult than others. You should answer as many of the coding challenges as possible using real code but the minimum to finish the application is 2 easy challenges and 2 medium challenges. 

To submit your application, please follow the steps below:
1. Sign up for a REPL account [here]( https://repl.it/signup)
2. Choose a language that you wish to complete the application in (Python, Ruby, or Javascript) [here](https://repl.it/languages)
3. Once you choose your language, write your answer in the “main” sheet
4. Copy and paste the URL at the top into the application as your answer for that particular question
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for all coding questions
